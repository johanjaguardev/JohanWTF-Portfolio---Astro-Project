# Building a UX-Driven Portfolio with Astro and Modern JavaScript Technologies

![Placeholder Image](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

Hello fellow developers and tech enthusiasts!

As a full-stack developer with over a decade of experience, I've had the privilege of working on a multitude of projects across various sectors. However, one common challenge many of us face is showcasing our work, especially when it involves confidential projects in the private sector.

To bridge this gap, I've embarked on an exciting journey to create a basic portfolio project that not only serves as a learning platform but also demonstrates the breadth of my career. This project will be built using **Astro**, an all-in-one web framework, integrated with modern JavaScript technologies like **Strapi** for backend management, **React** for dynamic user interfaces, and **Vue** for building user experiences.

The goal is to create a UX-based portfolio that reflects the diversity of my skills and experiences without relying on proprietary work. Instead, I'll focus on personal projects that highlight my problem-solving abilities and technical prowess.

In the coming months, I plan to delve deeper into web technologies for my portfolio, as well as undertake backend projects and research in **Java** and **Kotlin**. This blog will serve as a chronicle of my progress and learnings.
