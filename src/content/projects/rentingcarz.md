## Project description. 

I played a key role in developing the initial version of the RentingCarz website, ensuring seamless functionality across mobile, desktop, and tablet devices. The site was available in multiple languages: Spanish, English, Arabic, and Japanese. Additionally, I contributed to a SaaS variant called AgentCars. Our technology stack included PHP, React, HTML, CSS, Sass, and the Yii Framework 2
