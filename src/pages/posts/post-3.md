# My Journey into Web Accessibility

In my previous job, I encountered a significant challenge that turned out to be a great learning opportunity: web accessibility.

Despite learning something new every day, I felt my knowledge was incomplete and unreliable. Practically, I picked up many tricks to support web accessibility on Windows with NVDA and JAWS and on Mac for VoiceOver. However, I still consider it a debt that I owe to myself to learn more about.

Now, as part of my learning path, I want to focus on becoming more proficient with accessibility. In my search for resources, I've found these three sites for training:

1. **Learn Accessibility - By Google** ([web.dev/learn/accessibility](https://web.dev/learn/accessibility?hl=en))

This is my top priority. It's a course offered by Google for developers and is packed with information. I'll keep you posted on my experience with this one.

2. **Sara Soueidan's Accessibility Site** ([sarasoueidan.com](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/))

I still have a lot to read and research here, but it sounds very promising and worth the investment.

3. **Web Accessibility by Google and Udacity** ([udacity.com/course/web-accessibility--ud891](https://www.udacity.com/course/web-accessibility--ud891))

This could be a great alternative.

Lastly, two essential tools we used within the company were the AQA extension by UsableNet and the accessibility features of Lighthouse.

This journey is just beginning, and I'll share my experiences as I go along.
