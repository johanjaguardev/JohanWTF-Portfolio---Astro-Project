# My Journey into Java as an Experienced Frontend Developer

After over six years as a frontend developer, I've decided to delve into the world of **Java**—a language that piqued my interest back in university. Now, years later, I'm looking to update my resume and gain experience as a backend developer in Java.

In pursuit of this goal, I sought out courses and sites offering robust foundations in Java and the renowned framework **Spring Boot**, preferably with some form of completion certificate.

My search first led me to [exercism.com](https://exercism.com), which caught my eye with its gamification approach. It offers an engaging interface that rewards you with badges and focuses on clear concepts and learning by doing—a fundamental aspect for me.

After completing the basic concepts tree, I was eager to explore more advanced features of Java and Spring Boot, particularly those applicable in the job market. However, I encountered several alternatives, including a video in youtube of TodoCode (in spanish) and a roadmap pdf that She suggest, and another alternatives that didn't quite meet my expectations.

Codecademy was comprehensive and hands-on, but I was put off by their seemingly deceptive tactics for charging for an automatically generated diploma upon course completion.

Next was ([Spring.io Quickstart](https://spring.io/quickstart)), which offered interesting information for getting started with Spring Boot but seemed disorganized, eventually leading to a paid section for deeper learning.

Then there was a course offered by the University of Helsinki ([java-programming.mooc.fi](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/)), which had great content but outdated and neglected software that hindered my progress.

Ultimately, I chose two paths: first, HyperSkill by JetBrains ([HyperSkill Java Path](https://hyperskill.org/categories/2)), considering a Pro subscription if necessary later on; second, exploring Kotlin through Udacity ([udacity.com/enrollment/ud9011](https://www.udacity.com/enrollment/ud9011)).

I'm just starting both courses without any rush. I'll keep updating you on my experiences here on this blog.

Thank you for reading.
